    "text": "1D interacting stochastic many-body particle system\nThe studying interacting stochastic many-body particle systems analytically is quite limited to a few simple cases. As a result, it is imperative to study such complex systems numerically. However, these simulations can take up hours if not days, due to the sheer number of particles that might be needed in the simulations. Here, I started implementing one such codebase in Rust that can be extended and optimised for such purposes.\nMoreover, I’m now developing a GPU-accelerated version of this codebase in order to simulate 10M particles under a day using Apple GPUs. This work is still in progress."

    "title": "How to create a Docker container and use with Singularity/Apptainer in HPC environments",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe demand for computational power for scientific research has increased dramatically in the last decade. To deal with this demand, high-performance computing (HPC) clusters have been established as a collaboration between multiple research institutions and universities, providing thousands of researchers with a large pool of shared computing resources. Simply put, HPC clusters are a bunch of interconnected computers where individual users can carry out large-scale computations. Due to security reasons, only a few administrators can install software on these computers. As a result, individual users are constrained to use only the software provided by the administrators, limiting the use-case of HPC clusters. Singularity and docker solve this issue by allowing individual users to create and run custom virtual software environments where they can install any software they like. In this blog post, I’ll show you how to create a docker container and use it with singularity (a.k.a. apptainer).\n\n\nStep 1: Create a dockerfile\nTo create a docker container, we first need to create what is called a dockerfile.\n\ntouch my.dockerfile\nvi my.dockerfile\n\nInside the my.dockerfile, we need to list instructions for Docker to create a docker container. The format of a typical docker container that I use looks as follows:\n\n# Dockerfile for Seurat 4.3.0\nFROM rocker/r-ver:4.2.0\n# Install Seurat's system dependencies\nRUN apt-get update\nRUN apt-get install -y \\\n    libhdf5-dev \\\n    libcurl4-openssl-dev \\\n    libssl-dev \\\n    libpng-dev \\\n    libboost-all-dev \\\n    libxml2-dev \\\n    openjdk-8-jdk \\\n    python3-dev \\\n    python3-pip \\\n    wget \\\n    git \\\n    libfftw3-dev \\\n    libgsl-dev \\\n    pkg-config\nRUN apt-get install -y llvm-10\n# Install system library for rgeos\nRUN apt-get install -y libgeos-dev\n# Install UMAP\nRUN LLVM_CONFIG=/usr/lib/llvm-10/bin/llvm-config pip3 install llvmlite\nRUN pip3 install numpy\nRUN pip3 install umap-learn\nRUN git clone --branch v1.2.1 https://github.com/KlugerLab/FIt-SNE.git\nRUN g++ -std=c++11 -O3 FIt-SNE/src/sptree.cpp FIt-SNE/src/tsne.cpp FIt-SNE/src/nbodyfft.cpp  -o bin/fast_tsne -pthread -lfftw3 -lm\n# Install bioconductor dependencies & suggests\nRUN R --no-echo --no-restore --no-save -e \"install.packages('BiocManager')\"\n\nIn each line, the capitalised words are instructions for docker to tell what to do with the code following those words. For example, FROM tells docker that it should use the docker container located at hub.docker.com/layers/rocker/r-ver/4.2.0 as a base image and build the container on top of that image. This is typically used to set the operating system of the docker container, e.g. ubuntu, Fedora, etc. . In this particular case, I’m using the official docker container of R programming language version 4.2.0 as the base so that I don’t have to install it myself.\nThe lines following the first line tell which commands to execute to set up the container. For example, in the second line, I’m first updating the virtual operating system of the docker container, and then in the third line, I’m installing some libraries to the operating system that will be needed for the R packages that I use. The details of how to set up a docker container are beyond the scope of this blog post, so I’ll skip that for the moment.\nOnce you finish setting up the dockerfile, now we are ready to build the container and upload it somewhere so that we can access it whenever we want.\n\n\nStep 2: Create the docker container and push it to dockerhub\nAssuming that you are creating the docker container in a non-Linux environment, we will tell the docker that the container will be used in the Linux environment while we create the container.\n\ndocker build -t mycontainer:latest . -f my.dockerfile  --platform linux/x86_64 2&gt;&1 | tee build.log\n\nHere, mycontainer:latest gives the container a name and a tag to easily identify it. The tag is like a version of that container. The dot . following tells the docker that the docker file -f my.dockerfile is located at the current location where this command is executed. The parameter --platform Linux/x86_64 tells docker that the container should be compatible with a Linux host. Once you execute the above command, it can take from minutes to hours to create the container, depending on what you asked the docker to install to your container.\nOnce the creation of the container is complete, we need to push it a dockerhub as a repository. First, create an account at dockerhub. Then create a repository at dockerhub on the website. You will push the container you created on your computer to the repo you created in docker hub. Then from your terminal, log into your account\n\ndocker login --username &lt;dockerhub username&gt;\n\nNow you first need to tag the docker container in your computer to the repo in the dockerhub. List all docker images and copy IMAGE ID of that container. It should be a 12-character alphanumeric string, something like 76ad0cae35c3.\n\ndocker image ls\n\nOnce you find the IMAGE ID of your container, we tag it to the repo as\n\ndocker tag &lt;IMAGE ID&gt; &lt;dockerhub username&gt;/&lt;repo name&gt;\n\nNow we are ready to push the container that is still stored in your computer to the repo at &lt;dockerhub username&gt;/&lt;repo name&gt;.\n\ndocker push &lt;dockerhub username&gt;/&lt;repo name&gt;\n\nIt might take some time for the push to finish if this is your first time creating this container and it is a large container.\n\n\nStep 3: Run the docker container with Singularity/Apptainer\nHaving created the docker container and stored it in the dockerhub, we are ready to use with singularity. Log into the HPC cluster and make sure that the singularity/apptainer is installed already. We first make sure that the cache directories are created - otherwise, singularity will complain. Then we can directly run the docker container with singularity in the following way:\n\nmkdir $SINGULARITY_TMPDIR \nmkdir $APPTAINER_CACHEDIR\nsingularity run  docker://&lt;dockerhub username&gt;/&lt;repo name&gt;:latest\n\nHere, the word docker before &lt;dockerhub username&gt;/&lt;repo name&gt;:latest tells singularity to search for the repo in the dockerhub. With this, singularity downloads the docker container at &lt;dockerhub username&gt;/&lt;repo name&gt;:latest and runs it. Once it is done, you will be inside the container and start using the software that you have installed in that container.\nHowever, typically, when we are running the docker container, we also would like to access the data is that in the host environment. As a result, we need to bind some of the directories in the host to a directory in the virtual operating system. Binding simply means that you make a directory in the host operating system accessible from within the container. To accomplish this we pass --bind parameter. The path before : indicates the directory in the host, and the path after : indicates the path inside the container.\n\nsingularity run --bind &lt;host path&gt;:&lt;container path&gt; docker://&lt;dockerhub username&gt;/&lt;repo name&gt;:latest"
