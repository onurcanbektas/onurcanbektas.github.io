        "The demand for computational power to carry out scientific research has increased dramatically in the last decade.\n",
        "To deal with this demand, high-performance computing (HPC) clusters has been established across the world as a collaboration between research instituations and universities.\n",
        "HPC clusters a bunch of inter-connected computers managed by a workload manager, such as SLURM, where individual users can request resources to carry out large-scale computations \n",
        "and these resources can be optimally allocated by the workload manager to maximise the utilisation of the available resources.\n",
        "Because these clusters are shared by possibly tausends of users, only few administrators are allowed to install software to these computers due to security reasons.\n",
        "However, the limited permissions the individual users have might restrict them from installing the necessary software that they might need to carry out their research.\n",
