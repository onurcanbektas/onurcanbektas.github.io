Hi! 
My name is Onurcan. 
I am currently a PhD candiate at the [Faculty of Physics](https://www.physik.lmu.de/en/index.html) at [Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München](https://www.lmu.de/de/index.html), where I work in the group of [Prof. Steffen Rulands](https://www.theorie.physik.uni-muenchen.de/lsfrey/members/group_leaders/steffen_rulands/index.html).
Before that, I was a Master student in the [Max Planck School Matter to Life](https://mattertolife.maxplanckschools.org/home).
Before that, I was a Bachelor student in the [Department of Physics](https://phys.metu.edu.tr/) and [Department of Mathematics](https://math.metu.edu.tr/) at the [Middle East Technical University, Turkey](https://www.metu.edu.tr/).

My current research has mainly two branches: one branch is to understand the biophysical mechanism of ageing and rejuvenation, the second branch is to understand the emergent phenomena intelligent robotic matter.

You can contact me at Onurcan dot Bektas snail lmu dot de.
